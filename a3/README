## Versions

Python: 3.11
NLTK: 3.9.1


## Runtime
Run on i9-13900HX CPU.
cell 6 takes two minutes to run.
cell 11 takes 2.5 minutes to run.
cell 13 takes 2min15s to run.
cell 14 takes 15s to run.

## Additional Features
- I optimize the running time of the original CKY algorithm implement by adding a binary rule production cache to speed
up the searching process.

- I implement the count_trees function to count the number of parsing trees without generate all the trees.

All these features are notified with "# Extra" in the code.
